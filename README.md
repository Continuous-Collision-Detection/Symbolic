Symbolic CCD using Mathematica, this repo contains two Mathematica modules that check if a vertex-face or edge-edge ccd query has collision.
The input of the functions is an 8Ã—6 matrix of integers, each column is the numerator denominator of the rational representation of the query point.

We also provide a Python script to batch-process all queries.
